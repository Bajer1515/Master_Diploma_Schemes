# Master_Diploma_Schemes
Repository with implementation of Identification Schemes that are considered in my Diploma Thesis "Chosen Identification and Signature Schemes - Randomness leakage analysis".
Programming languages and packages used in implementations are:
- JavaScript,
- Node.js,
- mcl-wasm,
- crypto,
- request-promise.

In this repository you can find:

1. Schnorr Identification Scheme

2. Mod-Schnorr Identifiaction Scheme

3. Okamoto Identification Scheme

4. Mod-Okamoto Identification Scheme

5. Chaum-Pedersen Identification Scheme

6. Mod-Chaum-Pedersen Identification Scheme.

In modifications of original schemes I used additional generator 'ghat', which is result of hash-function with input (X|c).
